ReadMe is a full stack web application that allows users to upload, rate, and share ebooks with other users. Read Me is a Backbone.js application that consumes a Ruby on Rails API serving models via JSON. Backend model associations are translated to the front end via overwrites of the Backbone.Model#parse method.

##TODOs
[] Complete implementation of subject model with assocations to books. Backend API complete. Need to implement in Frontend.
[] Build user/author pages.
